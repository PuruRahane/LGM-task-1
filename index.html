            <p>More than 65% of young people will work in jobs that don’t currently exist. Learning computer science skills helps students thrive in a rapidly changing world. Yet our research with Gallup shows that many students aren’t getting the Computer Science (CS) education they need—and teachers don’t have sufficient resources to provide it.</p>

            <p>Code with LEARNCODING helps to ensure that every student has access to the collaborative, coding, and technical skills that unlock opportunities in the classroom and beyond–no matter what their future goals may be.</p>

                <p>More than 65% of students will work in jobs that don’t even exist today,¹ but most young people aren’t yet developing the problem-solving skills or basic digital competencies that they’ll need to be prepared for that future.</p>
                <p>We are providing grant funding to nonprofits, building programs to expand access to computer science education, and helping train more female and underrepresented students in computational thinking. It’s our goal to prepare every learner with the adaptive skills they need to tackle the future's biggest challenges.</p>
